1. What are the key features of the application? Are these clearly separated into their own files, classes, and/or modules?

    The key features of the application are to generate a histogram for a list of words. At the moment of answering this question, the files of my project are clearly separated into their own files, and modules, but I have yet to use classes

1. Are the names of files, modules, functions, and variables appropriate and accurate? Would a new programmer be able to understand the names without too much contextual knowledge?

    The names of my functions are appropriate and accurate. The names for my modules and files need a bit of tweaking.

1. What are the scopes of variables and are they appropriate for their use case? If there are global variables, why are they needed?

    The scopes are mostly global due to the fact that I did not implement any classes.

1. Are the functions small and clearly specified, with as few side effects as possible?

    Yes, my functions are modular.

1. Are there functions that could be better organized in an Object1.Oriented Programming style by defining them as methods of a class?

    Yes, all my functions would do better as methods.

1. Can files be used as both modules and as scripts?

    Yes, my files can be used as modules and scripts.

1. Do modules all depend on each other or can they be used independently?

    Most of my modules require each other.
